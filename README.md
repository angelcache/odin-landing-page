# 🧙‍♂️ Odin Landing Page

A practice project where I recreated and customized the landing page from the Odin Project course using HTML and CSS.

## ✨ What I Learned
- Semantic HTML structure for clean, accessible markup  
- CSS techniques for layout, typography, and responsive design  
- Adding interactive styles like hover effects to enhance user experience
